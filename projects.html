            <p>This was one of the first projects I built during my time at DevMountain. 
               It's a simple, interactive webpage where users can vote for their favorite trucks. While basic in functionality, 
               this project helped lay the foundation for my understanding of user interaction, state management, and front-end design principles.
               It marks the beginning of my journey into web development and showcases my early growth as a developer.

            <p>This project is a fun and personalized take on the classic Space Invaders, built using Python and the Pygame library.
               It was an early exploration into game development where I learned the fundamentals of game loops, collision detection, 
               object movement, and sprite handling. I customized the visuals and mechanics to put my own spin on the retro arcade experience, 
               making it a great hands-on introduction to 2D game development.

            <p> This is an ongoing project for my father’s show, The Plastic Posse Podcast, 
                which dives deep into the world of scale model building and the joy of the hobby. 
                I'm developing a custom website using Python and the Django framework to serve as a central hub for the podcast's growing community.
                The site will feature episode information, updates, and links to all major platforms—creating one cohesive space where fans can stay connected and engaged. 
                This project blends my love for coding with my desire to support and elevate a passionate creative community.

            <h2>My Plans</h2>
            <p>
               Once I complete the Plastic Posse Podcast website, 
               I plan to dive into two major projects that reflect my passion for community building and user-focused tools:

              1. CreatorConnect – A Hub for Small Content Creators
              This platform will be dedicated to small streamers and content creators, 
              offering a space where potential sponsors, collaborators, and viewers can discover them in a deeper, more personal way.
              Beyond just tiles and brief bios, the site will provide custom creator profiles, showcase their community impact, 
              and offer direct links to their content across platforms.

              2. GameVault – A Personal Game Library & Journal
              GameVault will be a desktop or web app that syncs with your Steam library—and potentially other game 
              launchers—to give users a centralized view of their game collections. More than just a tracker, 
              it will include a journal feature where players can leave notes or summaries of their play-throughs.
            It’s a solution for gamers who want to pick up where they left off without having to restart or guess where they were in a game.
