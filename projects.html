            <p>This is a website that I am working on currently for my father. He runs the "Plastic Posse Podcast"
                where the podcast discusses all things Scale Model Building and all the fun that goes along with 
                the hobby. I will be using Python and the Django framework to build him a place for all his community
                to find the podcast information as well as be a social hub to link all platforms in one place.

            <h2>My Plans</h2>
            <p>I have 2 main plans for future projects once I finish the Posse website. First, I want to build a website
                dedicated to Small Content Creators and their Communities. A place where potential sponsors, viewers etc 
                can get to know a streamer/creator in a much more personal matter than just a few tiles and sentences and
                redirect them to where their content is. 
                Second, I want to build a program that can link with your Steam and possibly other gaming libraries where 
                you can sync your libraries and keep track of what games you own. I also want to add the ability to have a 
                section where you can make a note or journal entry on each game so that keeping track of current runs in 
                your games, and that way when you do come back to it you can have a journal entry and a summary of what you
                did last time you played so you don't have to restart and get a refresher. Way to keep track of all your games
                across multiple libraries.
